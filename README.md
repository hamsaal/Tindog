Welcome to website dedicated for dogs, the premier dating platform for dogs and their owners (joking)

While this may not have a full-fledged application, the website serves as a project of mine to showcase some important skills in CSS.


I have worked hard to create a simple and intuitive website that is easy to use and navigate. The Learning outcomes of this project were
. Getting some knowledge about UX/UI Design
. Knowing how to use css libraries
. Getting responsiveness in the website

This project really helped me to understand the importance of user experience,

So what are you waiting for? Have a look at the using the pinned url of the website and apprecite some dogs' love.
